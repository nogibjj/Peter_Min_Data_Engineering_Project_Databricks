# Databricks SQL Data Engineering Project
[![CI/CD Pipeline](https://github.com/nogibjj/Peter_Min_Data_Engineering_Project_Databricks/actions/workflows/cicd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/Peter_Min_Data_Engineering_Project_Databricks/actions/workflows/cicd.yml)

This is the README for my Databricks SQL data engineering project (mini project 6) for the IDS706 - Data Engineering Systems class at Duke University.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to learn about and build an ETL-Query pipeline based on Python3 and Databricks SQL warehouse. Throughout this project I learned how to:
- Manage secrets with `.env` and passing secrets to GitHub machines via GitHub Actions to run tests.
- Connect to a Databricks SQL warehouse w/ credentials.
- Set up a database within a Databricks SQL warehouse.
- Upload data to and query data from this database.

## Dataset
The dataset comes from FiveThirtyEight, an election polls, politics, and analysis website now acquired by ABC news. It contains a CSV file of detailed employment information regarding graduate students from different majors. Original data source is American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series.

## Referenced SQL Query
The complex SQL query I created aims to examine what academic majors that have more employed graduates than computer science and less unemployed graduates than computer science. Here is the query used:
```
SELECT db1.major, db1.major_category, db2.major, db2.major_category, 
db1.grad_employed AS cs_employed, db2.grad_employed AS other_employed,
db1.grad_unemployed AS cs_unemployed, db2.grad_unemployed AS other_unemployed
FROM default.hm246_grademployment AS db1
CROSS JOIN default.hm246_grademployment AS db2
WHERE db1.major = 'COMPUTER SCIENCE'
AND db2.grad_employed >= db1.grad_employed
AND db2.grad_unemployed < db1.grad_unemployed;
```
